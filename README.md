# **Memory Game Project**

## Motivation
This project was build in terms of Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program. The starter project had some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the game. My role was to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one.

## How to use?
The game board consists of eight different pairs of cards. The cards are arranged randomly and have hidden symbols. It is the player's role to flip cards over and match them in pairs. Each turn consists of flipping over two cards and revealing their symbols. If they match, both cards stay flipped over, if not, both are flipped face down. When all cards are correctly matched, the game ends.

The goal is to finish the game with the shorten time and with possible least moves as well as 3 stars rating.
